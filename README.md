Currently using SnobotSim, a simple project used for testing light program.

# Purpose
Simulate a manipulator in which an arm / wrist pivots on an elevator, and for the wrist / arm to go to the backside of the robot, the elevator must move to allow clearance. (Similar to 2337 - EngiNERDs in 2018)

If trying to flip over, must raise elevator before flip

If arm straight up, don't run elevator down.

If arm pointing towards floor and we go down too low, tip of arm will crash into floor.
